This is a visualizer of Djikstra's Shortest Path Finding Algorithm.


How This Works:
	->You can assign a start node and end node and obstacles in the way.
	->This algorithm would find the shortest distance to get from Node A to Node B
	->The first time you press any box, the start node will be placed.
	->The next time you press any box, the end node will be placed.
	->Black boxes(obstacles) will be placed if you click after placing start and end node.
	->Once choosing the start node and end node and placing obstacles, press "Space Bar".
	->The program would analyze each and every path to get to Node B from Node A and give us the best path.
